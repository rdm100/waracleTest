# waracleTest

I have recreated the website following the mockup given. I developed the page using semantic HTML and CSS only, 
avoiding using a framework for the development as suggested. However, if given the opportunity, I would have 
used tailwinds CSS. 

I started with the mobile view first and created a media query to add a breakpoint for larger screens to change 
the layout at 768 px.
